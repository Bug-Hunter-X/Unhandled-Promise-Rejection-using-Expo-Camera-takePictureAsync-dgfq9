This repository demonstrates a common, yet elusive, bug encountered when using the Expo Camera API's `takePictureAsync` method. The problem stems from attempting to use `takePictureAsync` before the camera is fully initialized.  This example shows how to reproduce the error and provides a solution using async/await and promises to handle the camera's initialization properly. The solution ensures the camera is ready before capturing an image, preventing the unhandled promise rejection.
